# 副词性从句
副词性从句的构造跟名词性从句类似，但是用法上有很大不同。名词性从句在主句中作主语，是不可或缺的成分，而副词性从句在主句中作状语，是可有可无的成分。

## 副词性从句的用法
副词性从句在主句中作状语，表示时间、地点、原因、结果、目的、条件、让步、比较、方式、伴随等。副词性从句可以放在主句的前面、中间或后面，位置比较灵活。
1. 放在主句前面：  
   - **When** he arrived, we had already started the meeting.  
   - **Because** it was raining, we stayed indoors.
2. 放在主句中间：
   - We, **when he arrived**, had already started the meeting.  
   - We, **because it was raining**, stayed indoors.
3. 放在主句后面：
   - We had already started the meeting **when** he arrived.  
   - We stayed indoors **because** it was raining.
## 省略副词性从句的引导词
有时为了避免重复，可以省略副词性从句的引导词，但必须确保句子仍然清晰易懂。通常在以下情况下可以省略引导词：
1. 当从句的主语与主句的主语相同时，可以省略引导词和从句的主语：  
   - He was very tired, **(because)** he had worked all day.  
   - She left early, **(when)** the meeting ended.
2. 当从句的谓语动词是be动词时，可以省略引导词和be动词： 
   - The weather is nice, **(as)** it is spring.  
   - The room was empty, **(when)** we arrived.
