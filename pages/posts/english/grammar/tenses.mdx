# 动词时态

最简单的英语句子，也不会缺少动词，而当你说到一个动词时，就意味着有什么事情发生。

在英语中我们总是很想知道，某件事是什么时候发生的。是现在、过去还是将来？这件事的状态是持续的还是已经完成了？

英语是一门讲逻辑又充满暗示的语言，通过对动词的变形来体现（暗示）事物发生的时间和状态，就是英语中所谓的时态。

<TensesTable/>

这种按时间和状态两个纬度来划分动词时态的方式，算得上是比较好理解的了，大家可以眼熟一下这个表格。但是作为普通的语言学习者，我比较推荐大家按更简单的方式来理解时态。

常规语法划分时态的状态一般是分为4种：简单式、进行式、完成式、完成进行式，本文推荐的是分为两种：简单式和完成式。做法是：
- 从语法上：把 be 看作动词，分词看作形容词补语
- 从状态上：如果只是说一个动作发生在什么时间段，就是简单式，如果有强调动作有截止时间点，就是完成式。
